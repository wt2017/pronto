kswapd tries to reclaim

Needs to evict inode (ext4_evict_inode)

Needs journal transaction completion (jbd2_complete_transaction)

Journal commit stuck on slow NVME I/O

DEADLOCK (for practical purposes)


- __Initial condition:__ NVMe is slow (high latency, low bandwidth)

- __JBD2 commit thread__ submits journal I/O, gets stuck in `wait_on_buffer()`

- __Memory pressure increases__ (due to normal workload)

- __kswapd wakes up__ to reclaim memory

- __kswapd needs to evict inodes__ → calls `ext4_evict_inode()`

- __ext4 needs to wait for journal__ → calls `jbd2_complete_transaction()`

- __kswapd blocks__ waiting for journal commit that's stuck on slow NVMe

- __Memory cannot be reclaimed__ because kswapd is blocked

- __More processes need memory__ → more page faults → more kswapd work

- __System runs out of memory__ → OOM killer may trigger

- __OOM killer may also need filesystem operations__ → also blocks on journal
